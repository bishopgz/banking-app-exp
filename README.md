# Banking Client's App - Java GUI
<hr>
This is a simple example of some basic actions in banking written in Java. It has client's modification capabilities, deposit and withdraw functions. The GUI is written using JavaAWT tools. This is also a work in progress so I'm going to add more capabilities in the future. Feel free to poke around or make any suggestions on your own.
Constructive input is welcomed. Happy coding!<br>
